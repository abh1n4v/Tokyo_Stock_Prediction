Forecasting data and methods:
    Qualitative forecasting: If no data is available or data given is irrelevant.
    Quantitative forecasting: 1. numerical data about the past is available
                              2. Some aspects of the past pattern will continue into the futur
                We wll be using quantitative forecasting


BASIC STEPS:

1. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
    Tokyo Stock Exchange prediction
    We will have to rank the change ratio of adjusted close price between the next day and 2 days later for each stock.
    Identify features that can be useful while making the models
        Predict rate of change of closing price of top 200 and bottom 200 stocks on the following business day(t+1)  till the next following business day (t+2);  highest to lowest expected returns.
        According to this, rank them according to the given metrics(*) for top and bottom 200
         - Rank indicates ranking of the change rate of closing price (close) of the next day and the next day for each of 2000 stocks.
           If the rate of change is large, it will be to the positive direction (buy for 100$ -> becomes 120$)
           If the rate of change is small, it will be large to the negative direction (sell for 100$->becomes 80$)
           This is why we take into consideration both top and bottom 200 of the ranked list.

    Construct a robust model that predicts the "Target" column for top and bottom 200 stocks for the upcoming days. (i think im supposed to predict the buy price and sale price for t+1 and t+2, and then rank them accordingly)

2. GATHERING INFORMATION:
    Data has been given by kaggle. (Around 2MIL rows of training data in stock_prices.csv alone)
    Fair to say, enough information has been provided (all real world information too, certain stock patterns can be correlated to evens that happened irl; eg:Failure of equity trading system on October 1 2020 which resulted in a lot of missing data on that day )

3. PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS:
    Make sure to use graphs, search for consistent patterns/ significant trends.
    Since the nature of market can change dramatically between two periods of time due to a multitude of reasons, the model should not depend on changes in the data distribution. Keep it simple

4. CHOOSING AND FITTING MODELS
    Models in consideration:
        DecisionTreeRegressor - basic test (should change)
        ARIMA - Autoregressive(AR) Integrated Moving Average (MA)
        XGBOOST - Extreme Gradient Boost
        LSTM - Long Short Term Memory
        + Simple and Exponential smoothing


5. EVALUATION
    Deal with missing values and outliers, and other practical issues.
    Using the model to make forecasts.( Current preferred accuracy of over 60% so that it is atleast better than a coin toss)
    Since kaggle has again provided supplementary data that will include data for coming months(june, july), evaluation and testing can be done more efficiently.
